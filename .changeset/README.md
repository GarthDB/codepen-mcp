# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been created by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of things you might want to do:

- **Adding a changeset**: Run `npx changeset` from the root of the repo, and follow the prompts to add a changeset.

- **Releasing changes**: Run `npx changeset version` to consume changesets, bump `package.json`, and update `CHANGELOG.md`. Then run `npx changeset publish` (or let the GitHub Action handle it).

For more information, see the Changesets documentation.
